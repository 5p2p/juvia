# About Juvia

Juvia is an open source commenting system. It allows you to outsource your commenting needs to an external system so that you don't have to build your own commenting system for each website or each web app. Embedding a Juvia commenting page only involves pasting a JavaScript snippet into your web page.

Juvia is similar to [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com/) and [IntenseDebate](http://intensedebate.com/). However both of them seem to be designed in the early 2000s before the rise of AJAX: trying to integrate either of them in an AJAX web application results in many wasted afternoons and a screen full of inexplicable JavaScript errors. Juvia offers full support for AJAX web pages and any JavaScript is written in such a way that it avoids conflicts with the page's existing JavaScripts.
