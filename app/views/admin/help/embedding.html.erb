<h2>Embedding a Juvia comments page</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Embedding a Juvia comments page only involves embedding some JavaScript code.
Embedding happens entirely in the browser: the page in which Juvia comments are
embedded does not require any server-side modifications. Juvia uses various
cross-domain request techniques in order to pull this off.</p>

<p>Juvia does not use any <code>iframe</code>s. The HTML for displaying the comments
and the form is directly embedded inside the page. In order to work well with AJAX
web pages, Juvia never reloads the current page, nor does it ever redirect to another
page.</p>

<p>A few options must be set before the JavaScript actually works.</p>

<div>
<textarea readonly style="font-family: monospace"><%= html_unsafe(
    render(:partial => 'admin/help/code',
        :locals => {
            :container => '(a CSS path)',
            :site_key  => '(some site key)',
            :topic_key => '(some topic key)'
        }
    ))
%></textarea>
</div>

Available options are:
<dl>
    <dt>container</dt>
    <dd>The CSS path of the DOM element to embed the Juvia comments page in, e.g. <code>#comments</code>.</dd>

    <dt>site_key</dt>
    <dd>The site key. You can see this in the admin panel.</dd>

    <dt>topic_key</dt>
    <dd>The topic key. Its only purpose is to serve as a containing group for comments.
        This can be any arbitrary string.</dd>

    <dt>topic_url</dt>
    <dd>???</dd>

    <dt>topic_title</dt>
    <dd>???</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Cross-domain requests</h3>
<p>Fetching from and posting to on other domains is usually forbidden by the browser's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>.
Newer browsers support a mechanism called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>
(CORS) which allows browsers to perform AJAX calls to other domains, and Juvia uses
this <a href="http://caniuse.com/cors">whenever possible</a>.</p>

<p>On older browsers that don't support CORS, Juvia falls back to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>-like technique that
involves injecting <code>script</code> tags to perform cross-domain requests.
Request parameters are embedded in the tag's URL. However, because browsers
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/812925/what-is-the-maximum-possible-length-of-a-query-string">impose a limit</a>
on the maximum size of URLs, only a limited amount of data can be posted.
The lowest common denominator seems to be Internet Explorer which imposes
a limit of 2083 characters. This means that on non-CORS capable browsers,
the user will be unable to post large comments. In order to reduce the
impact of this problem, Juvia compresses the comment text with zlib.</p>
